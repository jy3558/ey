I designed a quantitative research project on food safety and public health in New York City that asks how closely restaurant hygiene grades and food-safety violations actually track real-world foodborne illness complaints and neighborhood health patterns. Using NYC DOHMH “Restaurant Inspection Results” as an objective measure of hygiene, I pair detailed violation and letter-grade data with spatially matched 311 complaint records on food poisoning and unsanitary conditions to capture residents’ lived experiences. To fill gaps that administrative data can’t reach, I also proposed an original NYC resident food-safety and illness survey with stratified sampling across boroughs and demographics, aimed at linking specific dining behaviors and symptoms to restaurant conditions. Together, these three datasets create a framework for regression and spatial analysis that can test whether the city’s grading system truly signals safety on the ground and where it may systematically under- or over-protect certain communities.
